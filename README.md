Welcome to the **Data Science Immersive Course** repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of projects and labs designed to solidify your understanding of core data science conceptsâ€”from statistics to machine learning. Whether you're a beginner or looking to deepen your knowledge, this course offers practical, hands-on experience with real-world datasets and problems.

## Repository Overview

This repository is organized into two main sections:

1. **Projects**: End-to-end data science projects that integrate multiple concepts.

2. **Labs**: Focused exercises to master specific skills and techniques.


## Projects
### [**1. SAT Trends Analysis: Exploring the Impact of Participation Rates on Average Scores (2017-2019)**](Projects/SAT%20Trends%20Analysis)

- **Objective**: Examine the relationship between state participation rates and average SAT scores in the United States.

- **Key Question**: What participation rate ranges are associated with scores above the overall average?

- **Highlights**:

  - Exploration of SAT score trends and participation rates across states.

  - Statistical analysis to identify optimal participation ranges for higher scores.

  - Insights into how participation impacts performance.

- **Tools & Techniques**: Python, Data Visualization, Hypothesis Testing.


### [**2. Bangkok Transit Property Insights: Analyzing Proximity and Pricing Dynamics**](Projects/Bangkok%20Transit%20Property%20Insights)

- **Objective**: Analyze how proximity to mass transit impacts residential property prices in Bangkok.

-  **Key Question**: Is there a correlation between distance from a station and property prices?

- **Highlights**:

    - Comparative analysis of property prices within and beyond a 1-kilometer radius of transit stations.

    - Machine learning models to rank stations based on their influence on property values.

    - Insights into the pricing dynamics around BTS Skytrain and MRT subway stations.

- **Tools & Techniques**: Python, Regression Analysis, Geospatial Visualization.



### [**3. NLP Classification: Subreddit Pepsi vs Coca-Cola**](Projects/Subreddit%20Pepsi%20vs%20Coca-Cola)


- **Objective**: Leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify text data based on subreddit discussions about Pepsi and Coca-Cola.

- **Highlights**:

    - **Tokenization**: Breaking down the text into smaller units (tokens) such as words, phrases, or characters to understand the structure and content of the text.

    - **Vectorization**: Converting tokenized text into numerical representations using techniques like `CountVectorizer` and `TF-IDF Vectorizer`.

    - **Classification**: Training machine learning models (e.g., `Naive Bayes`, `Gradient Boosting`, `XGBoost`) to predict whether the text belongs to Pepsi or Coca-Cola.

- **Tools & Techniques**: Python, NLP Libraries (e.g., NLTK, SpaCy), Machine Learning Algorithms.

### [**4. Classification of Thai Logistics Research Papers**](https://github.com/iffan20/Logistics-Research-Papers-Classification)


- **Objective**: Classify Thai logistics research papers into predefined categories related to logistics themes, such as supply chain management, transportation, and logistics systems.
- **Key Question**: Can machine learning and NLP techniques improve the organization and accessibility of Thai logistics research?
- **Highlights**:

    - Comparative evaluation of tokenization techniques, including Newmm (pythainlp) and WangchanBERTa.

    - Optimized text vectorization using TF-IDF with parameters tuned to reduce feature noise (e.g., `max_features = 5000`, `max_df = 0.9`).

    - Neural Network model demonstrated the best performance with an accuracy of 71%, using a configuration of five hidden layers, early stopping, and dropout.

- **Tools & Techniques**: Python, NLP Libraries (pythainlp, Transformers), Machine Learning Models (Naive Bayes, SVM, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network).
